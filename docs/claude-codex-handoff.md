# Claude Code x Codex Handoff

This document defines the standard handoff between:

- Claude Code: implementation and iterative development
- Codex: review, regression assessment, and test verification

The goal is to keep development fast while making review and testing consistent.

## Role Split

### Claude Code

Use Claude Code primarily for:

- feature implementation
- refactoring
- bug fixing
- exploratory coding
- first-pass local validation

### Codex

Use Codex primarily for:

- code review
- regression and risk assessment
- test gap analysis
- browser-based verification
- API validation and edge-case coverage

## Shared Skills

The recommended shared workflow relies on these skills:

- `systematic-debugging`
- `api-test-suite-builder`
- `webapp-testing`
- `playwright`

## Required Handoff Format

After Claude Code finishes implementation, provide the following six items to Codex.

### 1. Goal

One or two sentences describing what changed and why.

Example:

```text
Goal: Fix enterprise token sync so newly synced models are visible on the My Access page without requiring a manual cache refresh.
```

### 2. Scope

List the main files or modules changed.

Example:

```text
Scope:
- core/enterprise/access_info.go
- core/enterprise/ppio/sync.go
- web/src/pages/enterprise/my-access.tsx
```

### 3. Root Cause

State the issue using the `systematic-debugging` mindset:

- what the symptom was
- what the root cause was
- why the fix addresses the root cause

Example:

```text
Root cause:
- Symptom: synced models did not appear immediately in My Access
- Cause: model cache refresh happened after channel sync in one path, but not after manual sync preview/apply flow
- Fix rationale: both sync completion paths now trigger the same cache refresh sequence
```

### 4. Risk Areas

List the most likely regression points.

Keep this short and concrete.

Example:

```text
Risk areas:
- stale cache after partial sync failure
- My Access page grouping by owner
- enterprise-only route path behavior
```

### 5. Suggested Verification

Tell Codex what to verify first.

Split by category when useful:

```text
Suggested verification:
- API: sync apply endpoint, my-access endpoint
- UI: enterprise My Access page refresh and model visibility
- Edge cases: sync with no changes, sync with one deleted model
```

### 6. Validation Already Performed

State what has already been run and what has not.

Example:

```text
Validation already performed:
- go test ./core/enterprise/ppio/... passed
- UI not browser-verified
- no full enterprise smoke test run yet
```

## Codex Review Workflow

When Codex receives a handoff, use this sequence.

### Step 1: Root-Cause Review

Use `systematic-debugging` principles:

- confirm the change addresses the stated root cause
- check whether the fix only masks symptoms
- identify hidden assumptions

### Step 2: Test Gap Review

Use `api-test-suite-builder` principles for backend or API-facing changes:

- auth coverage
- invalid input coverage
- status code coverage
- edge cases and boundaries
- tenant and permission isolation

### Step 3: UI and Flow Verification

Use:

- `webapp-testing` for local app workflow validation
- `playwright` for direct browser automation and deeper interaction checks

At minimum, Codex should try to verify:

- one primary happy path
- one auth or permission failure path
- one boundary or error path

## Minimal Operating Rule

For changes with user-facing or API-facing impact:

- Claude Code should not hand off without the 6-part summary
- Codex should not sign off without stating:
  - key findings or no findings
  - residual risks
  - what was verified vs not verified

## Recommended Prompts

### Prompt for Claude Code

```text
Finish implementation, then hand off to Codex using this format:
1. Goal
2. Scope
3. Root cause
4. Risk areas
5. Suggested verification
6. Validation already performed
```

### Prompt for Codex

```text
Review this change using systematic-debugging for root-cause consistency, api-test-suite-builder for test gap analysis, and webapp-testing / playwright for critical flow verification.
```

## Notes

- This process is intentionally lightweight.
- The handoff should be fast to write and fast to consume.
- If a change is trivial, keep each section brief rather than skipping the structure.

## Past Handoff — 2026-04-04 (Request History)

### 1. Goal

Add a user-facing "Request History" section to the enterprise My Access page so Feishu-authenticated users can browse their own request logs (with model/status filtering, cursor pagination, and request/response body detail).

### 2. Scope

**Backend:**

- `core/model/log.go` — removed mandatory `tokenName` guard from `GetTokenLogs`; empty tokenName now means "all tokens for this group"
- `core/enterprise/access_info.go` — added `GetMyLogs` and `GetMyLogDetail` handlers; switched timestamp parsing to `utils.ParseTimeRange` (ms-safe)
- `core/enterprise/router.go` — registered `GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs` and `GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs/:log_id`

**Frontend:**

- `web/src/api/enterprise.ts` — added `UserLog`, `GetMyLogsResult`, `RequestDetail` types; added `getMyLogs` and `getMyLogDetail` to `enterpriseApi`
- `web/src/pages/enterprise/my-access.tsx` — added `RequestLogsSection` component (time range picker, model filter, status filter, cursor-paginated table, detail dialog)
- `web/public/locales/zh/translation.json` and `en/translation.json` — 17 new i18n keys under `enterprise.myAccess`

**Commits:** `7a00a11`, `d6114ac`, `393238d`, `278248e`, `7262927`, `069425f`, `4125f9b`

### 3. Root Cause

```text
Root cause:
- Symptom: enterprise users had no way to view their own request logs; only admins could access /api/logs
- Cause: existing GetTokenLogs required a non-empty tokenName, making it unusable for group-wide queries
  from enterprise endpoints where the user may have multiple tokens
- Fix rationale:
  - Relaxed GetTokenLogs to treat empty tokenName as "no filter" (consistent with buildGetLogsQuery behavior)
  - New enterprise endpoints use Feishu auth → groupID for data isolation (users cannot see other groups)
  - Timestamp parsing bug: old parseTimestampRange used strconv.ParseInt + time.Unix, which breaks for
    JS millisecond timestamps; replaced with utils.ParseTimeRange (smartParseTimestamp handles ms/us/ns)
```

### 4. Risk Areas

```text
Risk areas:
- Data isolation: GetMyLogs scopes by feishuUser.GroupID — verify Feishu users cannot query other groups
- GetTokenLogs unchanged: tokenName guard restored (commit 278248e); relay-dashboard behavior unaffected
- Timestamp handling: utils.ParseTimeRange(c, -1) — no span cap; if both params absent,
  startTime is zero (no lower bound). Frontend always sends explicit timestamps, so this is safe.
  relay-dashboard uses ParseTimeRange(c, 0) which caps at 7 days — different by design
- Cursor pagination: now uses useInfiniteQuery; filter changes create a new query key, old pages are
  discarded by React Query automatically — verify "Load more" still appends correctly
- has_detail flag: detail button only renders when log.has_detail = true; detail fetch is gated by
  enabled: !!detailLog?.has_detail — verify behavior when detail storage is disabled globally
```

### 5. Suggested Verification

```text
Suggested verification:

API (use enterprise auth token):
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs — happy path, should return UserLog list
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs?model_name=gpt-4o — model filter
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs?code_type=error — error-only filter
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs?after_id=<id> — cursor pagination (append page)
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs/:log_id — detail endpoint (valid and invalid ID)
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs without auth — should 401/403
- GET /api/enterprise/my-access/logs with admin key (non-Feishu) — should work or reject gracefully

UI (browser, Feishu-authenticated):
- My Access page → "Request History" section loads at bottom
- Time range picker changes data
- Model filter filters results
- Status filter (success/error/all) works
- "Load more" appends next page; changing filters resets to page 1
- Detail button (FileText icon) opens dialog with request/response bodies
- Logs from other users are not visible (isolation check)

Edge cases:
- User has zero logs in the selected time range → empty state message
- Log exists but has_detail = false → detail button not rendered
- Log exists and has_detail = true but detail fetch returns 404 → dialog shows noDetail message
- Very long model name in table → truncation with tooltip
```

### 6. Validation Already Performed

```text
Validation already performed:
- go build -tags enterprise ./... passed (no compile errors)
- pnpm run build passed (no TypeScript errors, chunk size unchanged)
- Code reviewed by three parallel agents (reuse, quality, efficiency) ×3 rounds; all findings resolved
  - Round 3 fixes (commit 4125f9b): NoSpanLimit constant, modelFilter debounce 400ms, getNextPageParam empty-logs guard
- UI not browser-verified
- No integration test run against real DB
- No enterprise smoke test run
- Relay-dashboard GetTokenLogs caller (core/controller/relay-dashboard.go:157) confirmed to always
  pass non-empty token.Name from middleware — restored guard is consistent with this
- Isolation regression fixed (commit 278248e): GetTokenLogs guard restored; enterprise endpoint now
  uses dedicated GetGroupUserLogs which explicitly omits tokenName filter
- Stale-data regression fixed (commit 7262927): RequestLogsSection rewritten with useInfiniteQuery;
  no more state mutations inside queryFn
- Time range cap bug fixed (commit 069425f): ParseTimeRange(c, -1) — no 7-day clamp on logs endpoint;
  30-day / last-month / custom ranges now honored end-to-end
```

## Active Handoff — 2026-04-04 (Pure Passthrough + NativeModeChecker)

### 1. Goal

Implement full pure passthrough for PPIO and Novita Anthropic channels: the gateway forwards the raw client request verbatim (only replacing auth headers), captures token usage via dual-buffer SSE scanning, and exposes the feature as a per-channel config toggle synced from the admin UI. Also fix a `server_overload` error on non-Claude models caused by aiproxy injecting a `max_tokens` value beyond PPIO's internal cap.

### 2. Scope

**Core relay — passthrough layer:**

- `core/relay/adaptor/passthrough/anthropic_passthrough.go` — **new**: `headBuffer` (captures first 2 KB), `DoAnthropicPassthrough` (dual-buffer pipe, drain-on-disconnect, merge usage), `mergeAnthropicSSEUsage` (tail base + head fills zero fields)
- `core/relay/adaptor/passthrough/usage.go` — refactored: shared `extractUsageFromBytes(data, firstOccurrence)` backing `extractUsageFromTail` and new `extractUsageFromHead`
- `core/relay/adaptor/passthrough/adaptor.go` — extracted `forwardResponseHeaders` helper (was duplicated inline); `getPathBaseMap` renamed to `GetPathBaseMap` (exported for ppio adaptor)

**Core relay — anthropic adaptor:**

- `core/relay/adaptor/anthropic/config.go` — added `PurePassthrough bool \`json:"pure_passthrough"\``
- `core/relay/adaptor/anthropic/adaptor.go` — `ConvertRequest` (mode.Anthropic): if `PurePassthrough`, forward raw body + client content headers; `DoResponse` (mode.Anthropic): if `PurePassthrough`, call `DoAnthropicPassthrough`; `Metadata()`: added `pure_passthrough` schema entry

**Core relay — PPIO adaptor:**

- `core/relay/adaptor/ppio/adaptor.go` — exported `PathPrefixResponses` / `PathPrefixWebSearch` constants; refactored `GetRequestURL` to consult `GetPathBaseMap` first then fall back to string-replace (removed the early-return on key presence); added `mode.Anthropic`/`mode.Gemini` case routing to `/chat/completions`

**Core relay — channel selection:**

- `core/controller/relay-channel.go` — `filterChannels`: builds a `native` slice alongside `filtered`; returns `native` when non-empty, using the already-fetched adaptor to avoid a second registry lookup (channels with `NativeMode(mode)=true` are preferred)

**Enterprise sync:**

- `core/enterprise/ppio/types.go` — added `AnthropicPurePassthrough bool` to `SyncOptions`
- `core/enterprise/ppio/sync.go` — threads `*bool anthropicPurePassthrough` through `EnsurePPIOChannels` → `ensurePPIOChannelsFromModels` → `createPPIOChannels`; Anthropic channel update block writes `pure_passthrough` (always if non-nil, default false if key absent); `runPPIODailySync` uses `SyncOptions{AnthropicPurePassthrough: true}`; `buildConfigFromPPIOModelV2` caps `max_output_tokens` at 32000 for non-Claude models on the `anthropic` endpoint
- `core/enterprise/novita/types.go` — same as ppio types
- `core/enterprise/novita/sync.go` — same threading pattern; `runNovitaDailySync` uses `SyncOptions{AnthropicPurePassthrough: true}`
- `core/enterprise/init.go` — passes `nil` for `anthropicPurePassthrough` on startup (preserves existing channel flag)

**Frontend:**

- `web/src/types/ppio.ts` — added `anthropic_pure_passthrough?: boolean` to `SyncOptions`
- `web/src/types/novita.ts` — same
- `web/src/pages/enterprise/ppio-sync.tsx` — added "Anthropic 渠道纯透传" Switch toggle in sync config card; default state `true`
- `web/src/pages/enterprise/novita-sync.tsx` — same
- `web/public/locales/zh/translation.json` — 2 keys per provider section: `anthropicPurePassthrough`, `anthropicPurePassthroughHint`
- `web/public/locales/en/translation.json` — same

**Bug fixes (same session):**

- `web/src/api/enterprise.ts` — `used_amount?: number` (optional); fixes crash on undefined in `formatAmount`
- `web/src/pages/enterprise/my-access.tsx` — `formatAmount(log.used_amount ?? 0)` null-coalescing

### 3. Root Cause

```text
Root cause — pure passthrough:
- Symptom: PPIO Anthropic channel (type=14, anthropic.Adaptor) was performing full protocol
  conversion: injecting max_tokens, transforming body AST, parsing structured SSE for usage.
  This caused subtle incompatibilities (max_tokens exceeding PPIO's internal cap, context_management
  fields rejected by PPIO with 400, image URL conversion adding latency).
- Design intent: PPIO/Novita channels should act as authenticated reverse proxies — only auth
  headers replaced, everything else forwarded verbatim. "Pure passthrough" is now opt-in per channel.
- Why per-channel flag (not per-adaptor type): Channel 4 stays type=14 (ChannelTypeAnthropic) so
  NativeModeChecker routes Anthropic requests to it preferentially. Changing to type=54 (PPIO) would
  make both channels non-native for Anthropic mode, causing random channel selection between the
  OpenAI and Anthropic endpoints.

Root cause — max_tokens server_overload (xiaomimimo/mimo-v2-pro):
- Symptom: requests to mimo-v2-pro via Anthropic protocol returned server_overload.
- Cause: aiproxy synced max_output_tokens=131072 from PPIO catalog; PPIO's Anthropic proxy
  internally caps non-Claude models at 32000 and rejects higher values with server_overload.
- Fix: buildConfigFromPPIOModelV2 caps max_output_tokens at 32000 for models with "anthropic"
  endpoint that are not Claude models (name does not contain "claude").

Root cause — NativeModeChecker:
- Symptom: Anthropic protocol requests could be routed to the OpenAI channel (type=54) which
  requires Anthropic→OpenAI conversion, defeating passthrough intent.
- Fix: filterChannels now tracks a "native" slice and returns it when non-empty, so channels where
  NativeMode(mode)=true are always preferred over protocol-converting channels.
```

### 4. Risk Areas

```text
Risk areas:

1. Usage capture accuracy (SSE dual-buffer):
   - headBuffer captures only the first 2 KB. If message_start SSE event is larger (unlikely
     but possible with long system prompt echo), input_tokens is missed (falls back to 0).
   - ringBuffer captures the last 4 KB. If message_delta (output_tokens) is emitted early and
     the remaining stream exceeds 4 KB, output_tokens is missed.
   - Non-streaming: entire body must fit in 4 KB tail buffer, otherwise usage is zero.

2. Scheduled sync resets pure_passthrough to true:
   - runPPIODailySync and runNovitaDailySync always pass AnthropicPurePassthrough: true.
   - If admin disables pure_passthrough via UI and a scheduled sync runs, the flag is reset to true.
   - Mitigation: admin can re-disable after sync; scheduled syncs run once per day.

3. Startup channel refresh preserves existing flag:
   - init.go passes nil, so EnsurePPIOChannels only initializes pure_passthrough=false if the key
     is absent. Existing channels already having the key are unaffected.

4. DoResponse config load error handling:
   - LoadConfig error in DoResponse is silently ignored (falls through to standard handler).
   - This means a corrupt channel config causes silent fallback to conversion mode, not an error.

5. NativeModeChecker preference is all-or-nothing:
   - If the native channel is degraded/rate-limited but the non-native channel is healthy,
     the selector still prefers the native channel (until its error rate exceeds maxRetryErrorRate).

6. PPIO GetRequestURL Anthropic/Gemini case:
   - mode.Anthropic and mode.Gemini requests now route to BaseURL+/chat/completions on the PPIO
     OpenAI channel. This assumes the OpenAI channel is always selected for these modes when
     PurePassthrough=false on the Anthropic channel — verify with disabled Anthropic channel.
```

### 5. Suggested Verification

```text
Suggested verification:

API (PPIO Anthropic channel, pure_passthrough=true):
- POST /v1/messages with streaming=true → verify SSE events pass through verbatim (no re-encoding)
- POST /v1/messages with streaming=false → verify JSON response is unmodified
- POST /v1/messages with cache_control in body → verify cache fields pass through
- POST /v1/messages without max_tokens → expect upstream error (not gateway error — gateway must
  NOT inject max_tokens in pure passthrough mode)
- POST /v1/messages with anthropic-beta header → verify header forwarded to upstream
- After request: check logs table for input_tokens and output_tokens (both non-zero)

API (pure_passthrough=false, conversion mode):
- POST /v1/messages (Anthropic protocol) → should still convert correctly via anthropic.Adaptor
- POST /v1/chat/completions (OpenAI protocol on Anthropic model) → should convert to messages format

PPIO sync:
- Run sync with anthropic_pure_passthrough=true → verify Channel 4 Configs["pure_passthrough"]=true
- Run sync with anthropic_pure_passthrough=false → verify Channel 4 Configs["pure_passthrough"]=false
- Verify scheduled sync (runPPIODailySync) preserves pure_passthrough=true

NativeModeChecker:
- Anthropic protocol request → verify it routes to Channel 4 (type=14), not Channel 3 (type=54)
- OpenAI protocol request → verify it routes to Channel 3 (type=54)

UI:
- PPIO sync page → "Anthropic 渠道纯透传" toggle visible, default ON
- Toggle OFF → sync → verify channel config updated
- Novita sync page → same

Edge cases:
- Client sends max_tokens > 32000 to non-Claude model with pure_passthrough=true → upstream error
  (gateway should not interfere)
- Client sends max_tokens > 32000 to non-Claude model with pure_passthrough=false → gateway
  should clamp at 32000 (via ModelConfig max_output_tokens) or pass through
- Streaming request disconnects mid-stream → drain goroutine should capture tail usage correctly
```

### 6. Validation Already Performed

```text
Validation already performed:
- go build -tags enterprise -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" ./... passed (no compile errors)
- pnpm run build passed (no TypeScript errors)
- Three parallel simplify review agents; two findings fixed:
  - headBuffer pre-allocation: make([]byte, 0, size) avoids 6 growth cycles per stream
  - forwardResponseHeaders extracted as package helper (was duplicated in adaptor.go + anthropic_passthrough.go)
- Double LoadConfig in ConvertRequest not fixed: ~5μs overhead on seconds-long LLM call; fix
  requires refactoring ConvertRequestBodyToBytes signature — judged not worth the churn
- Server restarted; basic /api/status health check passed
- UI not browser-verified beyond visual inspection
- No real Anthropic SSE trace captured against PPIO endpoint
- No integration test against live PPIO/Novita API
- No enterprise smoke test run
- DB for Channel 4 not yet updated — user must run a sync from the admin UI to apply
  pure_passthrough=true to the existing channel config
```
