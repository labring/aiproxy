## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the official Bright Data Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling LLMs, agents and apps to access, discover and extract web data in real-time. This server allows MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf and others, to seamlessly search the web, navigate websites, take action and retrieve data - without getting blocked - perfect for scraping tasks.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Web Access**: Access up-to-date information directly from the web
- **Bypass Geo-restrictions**: Access content regardless of location constraints
- **Web Unlocker**: Navigate websites with bot detection protection
- **Browser Control**: Optional remote browser automation capabilities
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with all MCP-compatible AI assistants

## 🚀 Quickstart with Claude Desktop

Through Claude Desktop Extension:

**Download the Claude Desktop Extension : [Bright Data's MCP Extension](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp/raw/refs/heads/main/brightdata-mcp-extension.dxt)**

Through `claude_desktop_config.json`:

1. Install `nodejs` to get the `npx` command (node.js module runner). Installation instructions can be found on the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
        "WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the default mcp_unlocker zone name>",
        "BROWSER_ZONE": "<optional browser zone name, defaults to mcp_browser>",
        "RATE_LIMIT": "<optional rate limit format: limit/time+unit, e.g., 100/1h, 50/30m, 10/5s>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

[List of Available Tools](https://github.com/brightdata-com/brightdata-mcp/blob/main/assets/Tools.md)

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

**Important:** Always treat scraped web content as untrusted data. Never use raw scraped content directly in LLM prompts to avoid potential prompt injection risks.
Instead:

- Filter and validate all web data before processing
- Use structured data extraction rather than raw text (web_data tools)

## 🔧 Account Setup

1. Make sure you have an account on [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com) (new users get free credit for testing, and pay as you go options are available)

2. Get your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users)

3. (Optional) Create a custom Web Unlocker zone
   - By default, we create a Web Unlocker zone automatically using your API token
   - For more control, you can create your own Web Unlocker zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE` environment variable

4. (Optional) To enable browser control tools:
   - By default, the MCP tries to fetch credentials of `mcp_browser` zone.
   - If you don't have an `mcp_browser` zone, you can :
     - Create a Browser API zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) or use an existing one and specify its name using the `BROWSER_ZONE` environment variable

5. (Optional) Configure rate limiting:
   - Set the `RATE_LIMIT` environment variable to control API usage
   - Format: `limit/time+unit` (e.g., `100/1h` for 100 calls per hour)
   - Supported time units: seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h)
   - Examples: `RATE_LIMIT=100/1h`, `RATE_LIMIT=50/30m`, `RATE_LIMIT=10/5s`
   - Rate limiting is session-based (resets when server restarts)

## 🔌 Other MCP Clients

To use this MCP server with other agent types, you should adapt the following to your specific software:

- The full command to run the MCP server is `npx @brightdata/mcp`
- The environment variable `API_TOKEN=<your-token>` must exist when running the server
- (Optional) Set `BROWSER_ZONE=<zone-name>` to specify a custom Browser API zone name (defaults to `mcp_browser`)

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### Browser Authentication Update

**BREAKING CHANGE:** The `BROWSER_AUTH` environment variable has been replaced with `BROWSER_ZONE`.

- **Before:** Users needed to provide `BROWSER_AUTH="user:pass"` from the Browser API zone
- **Now:** Users only need to specify the browser zone name with `BROWSER_ZONE="zone_name"`
- **Default:** If not specified, the system uses `mcp_browser` zone automatically
- **Migration:** Replace `BROWSER_AUTH` with `BROWSER_ZONE` in your configuration and specify your Browser API zone name if `mcp_browser` doesn't exists

## 💡 Usage Examples

Some example queries that this MCP server will be able to help with:

- "Google some movies that are releasing soon in [your area]"
- "What's Tesla's current market cap?"
- "What's the Wikipedia article of the day?"
- "What's the 7-day weather forecast in [your location]?"
- "Of the 3 highest paid tech CEOs, how long have their careers been?"

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Timeouts when using certain tools

Some tools can involve reading web data, and the amount of time needed to load the page can vary by quite a lot in extreme circumstances.

To ensure that your agent will be able to consume the data, set a high enough timeout in your agent settings.

A value of `180s` should be enough for 99% of requests, but some sites load slower than others, so tune this to your needs.

### spawn npx ENOENT

This error occurs when your system cannot find the `npx` command. To fix it:

#### Finding npm/Node Path

**macOS:**

```
which node
```

Shows path like `/usr/local/bin/node`

**Windows:**

```
where node
```

Shows path like `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`

#### Update your MCP configuration

Replace the `npx` command with the full path to Node, for example, on mac, it will look as follows:

```
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"
```
