## Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets you run AppleScript code to interact with Mac. This MCP is intentionally designed to be simple, straightforward, intuitive, and require minimal setup.

I can't believe how simple and powerful it is. The core code is <100 line of code.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

### Node.js

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "applescript_execute": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@peakmojo/applescript-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Python

Install uv

```
brew install uv
git clone ...
```

Run the server

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "applescript_execute": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/your/repo",
        "run",
        "src/applescript_mcp/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker Usage

When running in a Docker container, you can use the special hostname `host.docker.internal` to connect to your Mac host:

### Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "applescript_execute": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@peakmojo/applescript-mcp",
        "--remoteHost", "host.docker.internal",
        "--remoteUser", "yourusername",
        "--remotePassword", "yourpassword"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This allows your Docker container to execute AppleScript on the Mac host system. Make sure:

1. SSH is enabled on your Mac (System Settings → Sharing → Remote Login)
2. Your user has proper permissions
3. The correct credentials are provided in the config
